## 🏆 Highlight Project (So Far)

### 🎯 Smart Number Guessing Game – [Day 13](./Day13_guessing_game.py)

> Built with clean logic, feedback hints, high score tracking via JSON, and CLI interaction.

**Features:**
- Two difficulties (Easy/Hard)
- Intelligent hints based on guess distance
- JSON high score persistence (`json Projects/guess_game_score.json`)
- Modular structure (`load_score`, `save_score`, `get_hint`)

```bash
Run it with:
$ python Day13_guessing_game.py
